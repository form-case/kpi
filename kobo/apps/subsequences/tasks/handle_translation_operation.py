# TODO: Transcriptions take a different approach that has the benefit of
# avoiding Celery, by contacting Google only when the browser polls for
# updates:
# https://github.com/form-case/kpi/blob/d3b81c6d1a647c3676c0cc0affada8979d8f5112/kobo/apps/subsequences/integrations/google/google_transcribe.py#L89
# However, this means that someone starting an async job, closing
# their browser, and coming back too late (1+ day later?) would never get their
# results. The pros and cons of each approach need to be evaluated, and a
# standard approach needs to be adopted for both transcriptions and
# translations â€”jnm 20240403
